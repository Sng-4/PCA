## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Import the Library

```python
from matrix_math_group21 import add_matrices, multiply_matrices
```

### Step 2: Define Your Matrices (as 2D lists)

```python
matrix_a = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]

matrix_b = [
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8]
]
```

### Step 3: Use the Functions

#### ‚ûï Add Two Matrices

```python
result = add_matrices(matrix_a, matrix_b)
print(result)  # Output: [[6, 8], [10, 12]]
```

#### ‚úñÔ∏è Multiply Two Matrices

```python
result = multiply_matrices(matrix_a, matrix_b)
print(result)  # Output: [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
```
